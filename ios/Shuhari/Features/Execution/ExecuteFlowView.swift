/// version — the note, the remark, the photo, the tips — and what is filled decides
/// where it goes, at most one AI request per validation:
///
/// - **the note alone** is a cook that asks for nothing: it is recorded on the version
///   shown, and the flow ends;
/// - **a change** is a version that already exists: the cook modified the recipe at the
///   stove and ate the result, so the AI writes it down — it applies exactly what was
///   described and improves nothing — and accepting it creates a version already cooked,
///   never one to test. The note, the photo and the remarks land on IT: it is the plate
///   that was made. A remark typed beside it is the improvement to ask for NEXT, so it
///   chains a second proposal, this time from the version just written;
/// - **a remark** asks the AI for the next version to try, and the version it creates
///   lands on the to-cook list — it has not been made yet. Rated, the cook rides along
///   and is recorded, on accept, on the version shown: the one that was actually made.
///   Unrated, it is an improvement asked with no cook behind it and nothing is
///   recorded. Tips typed beside the remark are carried into the proposed version,
///   where they stay editable;
/// - **tips alone** are reworded and merged into the displayed version's own — in
///   place, no version created. A note typed with them is recorded first, on its own.
///
/// Nothing is saved before the proposal is accepted: closing it saves nothing, and

/// asked again (a new AI call, and a new one off the monthly allowance). The cook
