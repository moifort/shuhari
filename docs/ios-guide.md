# iOS Development Guide

## Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**, iOS 26.0 deployment target
- **Swift 6** with strict concurrency
- **GraphQL via Apollo iOS** (not REST) — typed operations generated from `shared/schema.graphql`
- **Firebase Auth + Sign in with Apple** (mono-user, but real auth)
- **Sentry** (`sentry-cocoa`, SPM) for error reporting
- Style: **Liquid Glass** — native iOS 26 components, no custom re-skins

Xcode project `ios/Shuhari.xcodeproj`, scheme `Shuhari`, bundle id `com.polyforms.shuhari.app`,
team `46C337T7YN`. The project uses `fileSystemSynchronizedGroups`, so new files are picked up
without editing the pbxproj.

> **Layer naming is role-based, not uniform.** The *coordinator* is a `*View.swift` (owns
> navigation + API); *pure presentation* is a `*Page.swift`; the *ViewModel* is a `*Store` (Home
> and most features) or a `*ViewModel` (Recipe). Atoms live centrally in `Shared/Components/` —
> features have no per-feature `atoms/`. Some features (Proposal, Import) only have `pages/`.

### The root tabs

`ContentView` holds two content tabs — **Cuisine** (`HomeView`, cooking: `RecipeType.cooking`) and
**Café** (`CoffeeView`, `[.coffee]`) — plus the trailing **Importer** entry (`.search`/`.prominent`
role), which opens the camera full-screen and belongs to neither.

Both tabs are the same machinery pointed at different types: one `LibraryStore(types:)`, one
`HomePage`, one `LibrarySection`, and the type-agnostic `recipeFlow`. What differs is what each is
filed by — a dish course vs. a brew method — which is why `HomePage`'s filter facet is
**primitive-first** (`Facet`: a title, `(id, label, systemImage)` options and a `Binding<String?>`)
rather than typed on `DishCategory`: the page filters on *something* without knowing what. The
domain-to-primitive bridges are `HomePage.Facet.course(selection:)` / `.method(selection:)`.

**A library opens filed, not dated.** `LibraryStore(types:sort:)` opens on `.dishCategory`
(`.brewMethod` for Café): sections per course, and inside each the order the server hands over —
favourites first, then by best rating, the recipes never cooked last
([business-rules](business-rules.md#derivation--no-promotion), `standing`). That order is the
finding aid, which is why there is **no favourites lens**: the hearts already lead every section.
"Dernière modification" stays in the sort menu as the second option, sectioned by month, for the
one question the filed order does not answer. On a `LibraryRow` the **heart replaces the stars** —
one trailing mark per row: a favourite is ranked on its heart, so its rating beside it would be a
number the order ignores.

**Searching by title runs on the device.** `HomePage` is `.searchable`; its `Search` is
primitive-first like the facet (`text` binding + `results`, `nil` while nothing is typed). The
first character makes `LibraryStore` fetch the notebook's **index** (`recipeIndex(types:)` — every
recipe of the tab, names only, one Firestore read) and `LibraryIndexEntry.matching` filters it
locally on every keystroke: case- and accent-insensitive, titles starting with what was typed
first, then the favourites. A paginated list cannot be searched past the pages it has loaded and
Firestore cannot match "contains" — hence the index. It is dropped whenever the library reloads,
and a result is a `LibrarySearchRow`: a name, what it is filed by and its heart, nothing a version
holds.

**The tab decides the import flow.** The entry is shared, what it runs is not: launched from Café
it reads the source as a coffee, from Cuisine as something cooked. `ContentView` derives an
`ImportFlow` from the tab it came from (`lastContentTab`) and threads it through `ImportJob` to
`ImportReviewSheet`, which calls `ImportAPI.analyzeCoffee` or `.analyzeCooking` and shows
`CoffeeImportPreviewPage` or `ImportPreviewPage`. Nothing is guessed from the source, and the
created recipe lands in the tab it came from. Closing the camera cover restores that tab.

**Closing an AI screen goes back one step, it does not leave.** An analysis or a proposal the cook
refuses returns to the screen it was asked from, with everything typed still there — a wording to
fix costs a re-read, never a re-type. The import rebuilds the composer from the `ImportJob` being
analysed (`ImportInput.draft`) and reopens the cover on it; `ExecuteFlowView` simply pops back to
its `CapturePage`, whose `@State` never left the `NavigationStack` root. Asking again is a second
AI call and a second unit off the monthly allowance — closing is free, re-asking is not. A flow
that already wrote a cook before proposing (tips) must not write it twice on the second
validation. The one thing that *does* leave: a run that has already written a **version** down (a
change accepted, then its chained improvement closed) ends there rather than coming back to a form
whose text would create that version a second time.

## Data fetching — GraphQL, not REST

All transport goes through Apollo. `APIClient` is reduced to resolving the base URL; there is no
REST data layer in the app (`Shared/Services/` is empty).

### The client

`Shared/GraphQLClient.swift` — a singleton `ApolloClient` pointed at `<baseURL>/graphql`, with an
interceptor chain that injects the Firebase token and logs:

```swift
final class GraphQLClient: @unchecked Sendable {
    static let shared = GraphQLClient()
    let apollo: ApolloClient
    private init() {
        let url = APIClient.shared.baseURL.appendingPathComponent("graphql")
        let store = ApolloStore()
        let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(
            interceptorProvider: AuthenticatedInterceptorProvider(store: store),
            endpointURL: url)
        apollo = ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)
    }
}

final class AuthenticatedInterceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider {
    override func interceptors<O: GraphQLOperation>(for operation: O) -> [any ApolloInterceptor] {
        var list = super.interceptors(for: operation)
        list.insert(FirebaseTokenInterceptor(), at: 0)   // Authorization: Bearer <ID token>
        list.append(GraphQLLoggingInterceptor())
        return list
    }
}
```

### The async helpers

`Shared/GraphQLHelpers.swift` bridges Apollo callbacks to `async`/`await`, surfaces GraphQL
errors as `APIError.graphQL`, and **fully disables the normalized cache**
(`cachePolicy: .fetchIgnoringCacheCompletely`, `publishResultToStore: false`):

```swift
let data = try await GraphQLHelpers.fetch(GraphQLClient.shared.apollo, query: ShuhariGraphQL.HomeQuery())
_    = try await GraphQLHelpers.perform(GraphQLClient.shared.apollo, mutation: ShuhariGraphQL.UpdateRecipeMutation(id: id, input: input))
```

It also provides `graphQLNullable(_:)` (wrap `T?` into `GraphQLNullable`, blank strings → `.none`)
and `parseISO8601(_:)` for the `DateTime` scalar.

### The library's opening page, on disk

The normalized cache being off means a relaunch used to hit an empty screen and a cold function:
several seconds of loader over a library that had barely changed. `LibraryCache`
(`Features/Home/LibraryCache.swift`) keeps that first page as JSON in the caches directory, one
file per tab, and `LibraryStore.init` reads it **synchronously** before anything is asked of the
network — the rows are on screen in the first frame. See
[a list that reopens never opens empty](swiftui-best-practices.md#a-list-that-reopens-never-opens-empty).

- **What is written**: page 0 of the tab's opening order, and only that — `saveCache()` bails out
  as soon as a facet or another sort is on. Written off the main actor, after each successful
  `load()` and after an optimistic delete, which no reload follows.
- **What is read**: nothing, unless the file decodes *and* carries the current `version` *and*
  holds at least one row — an empty library must show its first-run nudge, not a list that happens
  to be empty. Bump `LibraryCache.version` whenever `LibraryRecipe` changes shape.
- **The refresh that follows is silent**: its own `isRefreshing` flag, never `isLoading`, and
  nothing on screen while it runs — no spinner leading the list at every launch or tab switch, the
  cached rows are already readable. Only `refreshFailed` shows: `RefreshRow`
  (`Shared/Components/RefreshRow.swift`) leads the list with a "Réessayer" button, on the list's
  own background — the mirror of the failed `LoadMoreRow` that closes the list. Neither sits in a
  card: both clear their row background.
- **`loadIfNeeded()` owns the once-only decision** (`loaded`), not the tabs: their old
  `items.isEmpty` test would read a warm cache as "already loaded" and never refresh.
- **A write in the recipe flow invalidates, it does not reload.** The library sits behind the
  recipe, out of sight: `onReload` calls `invalidate()`, and `loadIfNeeded()` — attached to the
  stack's **root** view, so it runs again each time the cook pops back — reads page 0 once, in
  place, however many writes happened in between. Reloading on every mutation paid one library
  request per heart, rating or correction, for a screen nobody was looking at.
- **`AuthSession` clears every file** on sign-out and on account deletion: the next cook must not
  read the previous one's rows.

Gallery: `-gallery cuisine-refresh-failed` (the cached rows, with the retry leading them) and
`-gallery cuisine-paginating` (the pagination spinner closing the list).

### The feature API enum — the mapping boundary

Each feature exposes a caseless `enum {Feature}API` of static async functions that call the
generated operations and **map generated types → `Sendable` model structs**. Generated Apollo
types must never leak into views.

```swift
enum LibraryAPI {
    static func list(sort: RecipeSortOption, limit: Int, after: String?) async throws -> RecipePage {
        let query = ShuhariGraphQL.RecipeListQuery(/* sort, order, limit, after */)
        let data = try await GraphQLHelpers.fetch(GraphQLClient.shared.apollo, query: query)
        let recipes = data.recipes
        return RecipePage(
            items: recipes.items.map { recipe in
                LibraryRecipe(id: recipe.id, title: recipe.title,
                              type: RecipeType(graphql: recipe.type),
                              category: DishCategory(graphql: recipe.category),
                              versionCount: recipe.versionCount,
                              bestRating: recipe.bestRating,   // derived server-side
                              updatedAt: GraphQLHelpers.parseISO8601(recipe.updatedAt) ?? .distantPast)
            },
            hasMore: recipes.hasMore,
            totalCount: recipes.totalCount)
    }
}
```

For mutations, build inputs with the nullable helper; enum bridging (generated
`GraphQLEnum<ShuhariGraphQL.RecipeType>` ⇄ the design `RecipeType`) is centralized in
`Shared/RecipeType+GraphQL.swift` via `init(graphql:)` / `.graphQLValue`.

## Feature Pattern

### ViewModel — `@MainActor @Observable`, single-flight

Use the Observation framework (`@Observable`), not `ObservableObject`. Guard against stale or
concurrent loads (an in-flight task, or a generation token when the list paginates — see the real
`LibraryStore`). **Every network call shows a loading state** — flip `isLoading` around the fetch,
never a silent fetch that leaves the UI frozen. For a call fired by a CTA rather than by a screen
appearing, see [CTA + network](#cta--network--never-a-silent-wait).

```swift
@MainActor @Observable
final class LibraryStore {
    private(set) var items: [LibraryRecipe] = []
    var isLoading = true
    var hasMore = false
    var error: String?
    // Stale-response guard: each reload bumps the generation; a late response from a
    // previous sort/filter fails its guard and is dropped.
    private var generation = 0

    func load() async {
        generation += 1
        let requested = generation
        isLoading = true; error = nil
        do {
            let page = try await LibraryAPI.list(sort: sort, limit: 20, after: nil)
            guard requested == generation else { return }   // response from a stale view
            items = page.items; hasMore = page.hasMore
        } catch { self.error = reportError(error) }         // captures to Sentry + returns the message
        isLoading = false
    }
}
```

### `RecipeStore` — the recipe flow's one state

The recipe flow spans one screen and its sheets over the same recipe: the recipe sheet, the
history sheet and the to-cook sheet. They share **one**
`RecipeStore` (`Features/Recipe/RecipeStore.swift`), owned by the tab that hosts the flow
(`HomeView`, `CoffeeView`) beside its `LibraryStore` and handed down through
`.recipeFlow(store:path:…)` — see [one state per flow](swiftui-best-practices.md#one-state-per-flow-never-one-per-screen).

- `store.recipe(id)` is what the screen renders; `store.load(id)` is called by its `.task`
  (unguarded) and after every mutation, so one read updates the screen and its sheets at once.
- **Which version is shown is `@State` on the screen, not a route.** The history and to-cook
  sheets hand back a number, `selectedVersion` takes it, and the same screen redraws on a version
  the recipe already carries — no round trip, and the stack stays one deep however long the cook
  browses (see [browsing is a state change](swiftui-best-practices.md#browsing-siblings-is-a-state-change-not-a-push)).
  `RecipeRoute` therefore has a single case: a recipe.
- The flask CTA, its sheet and the version list can no longer disagree on what is left to test.
- `store.forget(id)` is called on the two delete paths, whose call runs in the background.
- `RecipeStore(previewRecipe:)` seeds a fixture and **never** calls the server: it is what makes
  the whole flow — sheets included — reviewable offline in `DebugGallery`.

The one screen still holding a copy of its own is `ExecuteFlowView`: the recipe sheet hands it the
recipe it already read, so the play CTA opens the flow with no request, and the flow reads the
recipe again only after it wrote a version the next proposal has to iterate on.

**One read per screen.** A screen asks for what it draws and nothing more: the `Recipe` query
names its `versionToOpen` by number and picks it out of `versions` (never the same version twice
on the wire), and a screen that needs a sliver of a recipe — the link sheet's weight step, a
name and a shopping list — has its own light query (`LinkedRecipe`) instead of the whole sheet's.

### Coordinator (`*View.swift`) vs. Page (`*Page.swift`)

The **coordinator** owns the `NavigationStack`, sheets, `.task`/`.refreshable`, and reads the
store from the environment. The **page** is pure: data in, closures out — no networking, no
navigation state.

```swift
struct HomeView: View {                        // coordinator (the Cuisine tab)
    @Environment(LibraryStore.self) private var store
    @State private var path = NavigationPath()
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $path) {
            HomePage(library: store.items, libraryLoading: store.isLoading,
                     libraryHasMore: store.hasMore, sort: /* binding */, onSettings: { … },
                     onLoadMore: { await store.loadMore() })
                .task { if store.items.isEmpty { await store.load() } }
                .refreshable { await store.load() }
        }
    }
}

struct HomePage: View {                         // pure presentation
    let library: [LibraryRecipe]
    let libraryLoading: Bool
    let libraryHasMore: Bool
    let onSettings: () -> Void
    var onLoadMore: () async -> Void = {}
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(LibraryMonthGroup.grouping(library)) { group in
                LibrarySection(group: group)
            }
            if libraryHasMore { LoadMoreRow(onLoadMore: onLoadMore) }
        }
    }
}
```

## Atomic Design

| Layer | Location | Receives | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Atoms** | `Shared/Components/` | Primitives | `Chip`, `RatingBadge`, `RatingStars`, `StepsList` |
| **Molecules** | `Features/{F}/components/molecules/` | Primitives | `LibraryRow`, `VersionTimelineItem` |
| **Organisms** | `Features/{F}/components/organisms/` | Primitives or a domain struct (mapping boundary) | `LibrarySection`, `IngredientsSection` |
| **Pages** | `Features/{F}/components/pages/` | Data + closures | `HomePage`, `RecipeDetailPage` |

A row that opens something is a `.plain` `Button` whose label ends in `.contentShape(.rect)`,
set in the row view itself (`VersionRow`, `LinkedRecipesSection`, `UsedBySection`): the whole
width answers the tap, never only the title —
[a tappable row is tappable across its whole width](swiftui-best-practices.md#a-tappable-row-is-tappable-across-its-whole-width).

Atoms in `Shared/Components/` are cross-feature. Promote a molecule used in 2+ features up to
`Shared/Components/`.

### Primitive-first leaf views

Leaf views receive only primitives — never the generated GraphQL types, and never full domain
model structs when they use a handful of fields.

**Allowed:** `String`, `Int`, `Int?`, `Double?`, `Bool`, `Date?`; simple enums without logic
(like `RecipeType`); closures. **Never:** generated Apollo types.

### Nested `Item` struct (5+ parameters)

When a component needs many parameters, define a nested `Item`. Example — `ParamsGrid`:

```swift
struct ParamsGrid: View {
    struct Item: Identifiable {
        let id = UUID()
        let key: String
        let value: String
        var highlighted: Bool = false
    }
    let items: [Item]
    var big: Bool = false
}
```

The mapping from model to `Item` happens at the page/organism level.

## Sheet toolbar CTAs — icons, never text

A sheet's toolbar action buttons (`.cancellationAction`, `.confirmationAction`, or any
`ToolbarItem` in a view presented via `.sheet`) **always** use an SF Symbol, **never** a text
label. Close is `xmark`, confirm/save is `checkmark`; pick the symbol that fits the action
otherwise (e.g. `sparkles` to launch an AI analysis). Always attach an `.accessibilityLabel` so
the intent survives for VoiceOver.

```swift
// ✅ icon + accessibility label
ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
    Button { dismiss() } label: {
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
    }
    .accessibilityLabel("Fermer")
}

// ❌ text label — also ❌ Button("Fermer", systemImage:) (renders the title next to the icon)
ToolbarItem(placement: .cancellationAction) {
    Button("Fermer") { dismiss() }
}
```

This keeps every modal's chrome to the compact Liquid Glass icon buttons. It applies to sheet
toolbars only — pushed pages and tab roots keep the platform's standard text actions.

## CTA + network — never a silent wait

The rule and its rationale live in
[swiftui-best-practices.md](swiftui-best-practices.md#a-cta-that-fires-a-network-call-never-waits-in-silence).
Here is what implements it in this app:

| Shape | This app |
|-------|----------|
| Inline spinner in the button | `ActionIcon` (`Shared/Components/ActionIcon.swift`), fed by `ErrorPresenter.isRunning` (`Shared/ErrorPresenter.swift`) whenever the action already runs through `error.run { }` |
| Full-bleed loader for long/AI work | `AIThinkingCard` (`Shared/Components/AIThinkingIndicator.swift`) — every Gemini wait (import analysis, iteration proposal) |
| Optimistic + background for one-way actions | `LibraryStore.delete(recipeId:)` — the recipe sheet closes at once, the mutation follows, a failure goes to Sentry via `reportError` and the reload puts the row back |

```swift
Button {
    Task { await error.run { try await RecipeAPI.updateRecipe(id: id, title: title) } }
} label: {
    ActionIcon(systemImage: "checkmark", isRunning: error.isRunning)
}
.disabled(error.isRunning)
```

## Previews as a Storybook + DebugGallery

Every component below page level **must** preview without a running server, fed by
`Shared/PreviewFixtures.swift` (`Fixtures`).

```swift
#Preview("Cuisine") {
    HomePage(library: Fixtures.libraryRecipes, libraryLoading: false,
             libraryHasMore: false, onSettings: {})
}
```

`Shared/DebugGallery.swift` (wrapped in `#if DEBUG`) renders any page with fixtures and no
server/auth. `ShuhariApp` branches into it when the `gallery` UserDefault / `-gallery <screen>`
launch argument is set (screens: `home`, `cuisine`, `recipe`, `recipe-tmx`, `history`, `attempt`,
`execute`, `execute-tmx`, `capture`, `proposal`, `import-preview`, `import-preview-tmx`,
`ai-thinking`, `root`).

**After finishing any iOS task, launch the result in the simulator on your own** — never ask
first. Once the code compiles: boot the simulator (iPhone 17, OS 26.2), install, then launch
straight into the affected screen with the gallery launch argument and screenshot it to verify
the change visually before reporting:

```bash
xcrun simctl launch booted com.polyforms.shuhari.app -gallery recipe
```

If the touched screen has no `switch` case in `Shared/DebugGallery.swift` yet, add one. This is
distinct from installing on the physical iPhone, which always requires an explicit yes (see
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#ios-physical-device-install)).

## Hide empty sections

A `Section` (Form or detail list) with no data must not be rendered at all — no empty-state
text, no placeholder, no "Ajouter" affordance. Guard every optional section:

```swift
if !items.isEmpty {
  Section("Ingrédients") { … }
}
```

An empty section reads as broken. Applies everywhere sections render data-driven **read-only**
content — the cooking import preview (Ingrédients), recipe display (`CurrentVersionSection`, …).
Hide, don't stub. A **form** is the exception: `CoffeeParametersForm` shows every field, filled or
not, because there what is missing is exactly what the cook has to see.

The rule has no "unless the section is editable" clause. It used to: a read section survived empty
so a first ingredient could be added from it. That crutch is gone with the edit CTAs — see below.

## Correcting a recipe — one door in

**The recipe sheet reads. `RecipeEditSheet` writes.** The sheet has exactly one way in, the more
menu's « Modifier », and it carries the whole recipe: title, the axis it is filed on, the note of
the version on screen, that version's content (shopping list + method, or a coffee's parameters),
its oven settings, its cautions and its tips. Nothing on `RecipeDetailPage` corrects anything —
no "Modifier" in a section header, no menu entry per concern. A page that both reads and writes
grows one entry point per field, and the same gesture ends up reachable three ways.

The one thing the read sheet still moves is the **ephemeral resizing** of the quantities: a lens
on what is stored, not a write. It holds on **every version the sheet shows** — the best-rated
one, an attempt read back from the history, and a version still waiting to be cooked, which is
the one a cook resizes most — and on **both worlds**: a dish is a ratio of its ingredients, a cup
a ratio of its dose, water, yield and milk ([resizing a cup](#resizing-a-cup)). One factor per
sheet (`RecipeDetailPage.scaleFactor`), whichever section reads it. Nothing is disguised by it:
the `×0,75` badge, the tinted quantities and « Réinitialiser » all say what is on screen is no
longer what the version stores. The corollary is that `IngredientsGrid` wears the change dots
inside the stepper's label — resizing an iteration never costs the marks saying what it changes.

Three consequences worth holding on to:

- **`RecipeDraft` is the whole sheet, in one value** (`Features/Recipe/RecipeDraft.swift`): the
  aggregate's fields plus the version's, each list held as rows with an identity of their own
  (`IngredientRow`, `StepRow`, `TextRow`) because a name cannot identify a row while it is being
  typed. Each list draft exposes the domain value under its domain noun — `ingredients`, `steps`,
  `lines` — like `OvenProfileDraft.profile` and `CoffeeParametersDraft.parameters` already did.
- **`RecipeAPI.correct(from:to:)` writes back only what moved, in one call.** The diff decides
  which fields of `correctVersion`'s `CorrectionInput` are sent — the recipe (title, course,
  method, tags), the rating, each list, the oven (`null` = never bakes), the coffee dials — and the
  server saves them in one transaction: the sheet lands whole or not at all, and a sheet closed on
  nothing moved sends nothing. It used to be one mutation per concern, in sequence: eight round
  trips for a full edit, and a failure halfway left half a sheet saved. Nothing creates a version —
  correcting what the recipe always said is not iterating on it.
- **Every list edits the same way**: type on a line, swipe it away, add one at the end
  («  Ajouter un ingrédient », « Ajouter une étape », « Ajouter un avertissement », « Ajouter un
  conseil »). Reordering and multi-deletion need the edit mode, behind a « Réorganiser » button —
  never SwiftUI's `EditButton`, whose label is "Modifier", the name of the sheet itself.

The sections are organisms of their own so each previews offline: `IngredientsEditSection`,
`StepsEditSection`, and `TextLinesEditSection`, which serves both the cautions and the tips (it is
told what it writes, it does not know which). The oven and the coffee reuse the forms they already
had, `OvenProfileForm` and `CoffeeParametersForm`.

Gallery: `-gallery recipe-edit`, `recipe-edit-thermomix`, `recipe-edit-oven`,
`recipe-edit-oven-copy`, `recipe-edit-coffee`, `recipe-edit-fresh`, and `recipe-edit-blank` — an
import that recognised nothing, where every section is empty at once. That last one is the reason
the read sheet may drop its empty sections: the first ingredient of a recipe is written here.

## The recipes a recipe is made of

`Recipe.components` carries them — the bread's poolish, each with the weight it goes in at
([business rule](business-rules.md#composition--a-recipe-is-made-of-other-recipes)). The sheet opens
on two sections above the shopping list: `LinkedRecipesSection` ("Recettes liées") and
`UsedBySection` ("Utilisée par"), the same link read backwards. Both render nothing when empty, so
the whole feature is invisible on a recipe that stands alone.

Four things worth knowing before touching those files:

- **The weight travels in the route.** `RecipeRoute.recipe(id:scale:)` defaults to `1`; a row of
  "Recettes liées" pushes the linked recipe at the weight it was linked at, and `RecipeDetailPage`
  opens on it (`openedAt`). That is also what "Réinitialiser" goes back to — landing on the stored
  quantities would drop what the cook asked for. A row of "Utilisée par" pushes at `1`: the weight
  belongs to the recipe that posted the link.
- **Linking is a menu entry, then two steps.** "Lier une recette" opens `LinkRecipeSheet`: the
  notebook, then `LinkWeightForm` on the picked recipe's own shopping list. Both are
  primitive-first and preview offline — the sheet loads, `WeightStep` loads the recipe, the forms
  know nothing of the network.
- **The picker reads the index, not the library.** `LibraryStore` is paginated: an alphabet built
  on it would only reach the first page. The sheet fetches `recipeIndex` (every cooking recipe at
  once, current one excluded) and hands ids and titles to `LinkCandidateList`: alphabetical in
  French collation ("Bœuf" before "Brioche"), one section per initial letter with the native
  section index down the side (`sectionIndexLabel`), "#" after Z, and a `.searchable` that ignores
  accents and case. The index carries no `bestRating`, so a candidate row is its title alone.
- **A weight is typed OR walked.** `QuantityScaling.factor(from:to:)` reads the quantity wanted on
  a line ("Farine 100 g"), `factorAfterStep` walks it with the −/+; both go through the same
  `rescale`, which rewrites every line from the single factor. The text field and the stepper are
  siblings, never nested: a field inside a stepper's label fights it for the tap. The coffee sheet
  resizes on those exact two doors ([resizing a cup](#resizing-a-cup)).
- **Correcting and unlinking are swipes** on a "Recettes liées" row — "Poids" reopens the weight
  step (`LinkRecipeSheet(editing:)`, which skips the list), "Délier" calls `unlinkComponent`.

Gallery: `-gallery recipe-component` (a sheet with both sections), `-gallery link-recipe` (the
picker, which needs the network), `-gallery link-candidates` (its list, offline) and
`-gallery link-weight` (the weight step).

## The coffee sheet — parameters, not ingredients

A coffee has no ingredient list: `CoffeeParametersSection` takes the place of
`IngredientsSection` on `RecipeDetailPage`. Five blocks — Café (with
`"12 juin 2026 · J+14"`, the roast date and how long the beans rested), Eau, Extraction, Lait,
Matériel — each disappearing entirely when nothing in it is filled in, per the rule above.

A coffee has **no steps at all** — it is a set of dials, not a sequence of gestures — so no step
section ever renders on one.

The section stays primitive-first; the domain → primitives adapter is a convenience initializer
in the same file (`init(parameters:restDays:big:)`), so no two screens word a date differently.

**Writing a coffee goes through one form.** `CoffeeParametersForm` (+ its `CoffeeParametersDraft`)
is the single shape of a coffee being typed, used by the three moments one is written: the
correction sheet (`RecipeEditSheet`), the import preview (`CoffeeImportPreviewPage`) and
the AI proposal (`CoffeeProposalPage`). It always shows every field; it pre-fills machine and
grinder from what was used most recently; it opens the milk block on a milk drink; and given a
`changedFrom`, it marks each moved value with the proposal's changed dot. DebugGallery:
`import-preview-coffee`, `import-preview-coffee-empty`, `import-preview-coffee-milk`,
`proposal-coffee`, `recipe-edit-coffee`.

Every row goes through the form's own `row(_:alignment:)`, which owns the changed dot's gutter:
present on all rows of a proposal, absent from all rows everywhere else, per
[the shared leading edge](swiftui-best-practices.md#every-row-of-a-form-shares-one-leading-edge).
Nothing in the form draws that column itself.

The leading header capsule on a coffee says **how it is brewed** (ESPRESSO, V60, FRENCH PRESS):
the method is what identifies it. `RecipeHeaderBadges(methodLabel:methodIcon:)` — nil on anything
else. The recipe type itself is never a badge — what a recipe wears is its
[tags](#tags--the-badges-a-recipe-wears).

### Tags — the badges a recipe wears

A recipe's [tags](business-rules.md#tags--what-a-recipe-is-filed-under) are drawn in two places,
and both take `[TagBadge]` (label + optional `Image`, mapped by the page through `Tag.badge`) —
never the domain `Tag`:

- `LibraryRow(tags:)` closes the subtitle with **icon-only** compact `Chip`s, one per tag that
  wears an icon; a tag without one is not drawn there.
- `RecipeHeaderBadges(tags:)` shows every tag, icon and words, ahead of the version capsule, in a
  `FlowLayout` so several tags fold onto a second line. The badges are the **header of an empty
  `Section`**, not a row: a row is clipped to the list's rounded corners, which bite into the
  capsules as soon as there are two lines of them.

`TagIcon` (`Shared/Tag.swift`) is the design-facing twin of the server's closed icon set — it
owns the drawing (SF Symbol, or the `thermomix` asset) and the French name the picker shows.
Tags are edited in `RecipeEditSheet` through `TagsEditSection` (icon menu + text field per row,
eight rows at most) and travel with the title and the course in the single `correctVersion` call.
DebugGallery: `cuisine`, `recipe-thermomix`, `recipe-edit-thermomix`.

### Resizing a cup

A cup is a ratio, so it resizes like a shopping list — the same `QuantityScaling`, the same two
doors (type the amount, or walk it with the −/+), the same badge and « Réinitialiser », and the
same single factor, which `RecipeDetailPage` hands to whichever section is on screen.

Three things are specific to the cup:

- **Four quantities move, and they are named, not detected**: the dose, the water, the yield in the
  cup and the milk (`CoffeeParametersSection.Quantity`). Everything else stays exactly as written —
  and it has to be spelled out, because "93°C" and "28 s" lead with a number and would follow along
  otherwise. A bigger cup is not a longer extraction, nor a hotter water.
- **The badge lands on the first block that can be resized** — "Café" when a dose is filled in,
  "Eau" on a V60 logged without one. A block nothing is filled in for is not rendered at all, so
  hosting the reset on a fixed block would let it vanish while a factor is still on.
- **A `scale` is what makes the section adjustable**, and it is optional: nil renders strictly what
  is stored, which is what the import preview and the execution mode want — they read a cup, they
  do not brew a bigger one.

### Correcting the note

The note belongs to the *version* on screen, so its row in `RecipeEditSheet` is labelled « Note de
la version *n* » — it must be clear which verdict is being moved — and it sits in a block of its
own, apart from the title and the course, which belong to the recipe.

The stars are the same `StarRating` the capture page uses, in its `compact` size: a form row's
value closes the line the way the course picker does, so the note reads as one more row instead of
floating on the background. The big stars stay where the note is the question being asked.

A version never rated shows empty stars: rating it there is the one way to log a cook after the
fact, and the server then treats it as cooked (see
[business-rules](business-rules.md#lineage-and-attempts)). Taking a note back is not a gesture the
server has — an emptied rating leaves the one already given.

### Correcting the parameters

A coffee's parameters are a section of the edit sheet like any other (`CoffeeParametersForm` in
place of the shopping list, the method in place of the course). They are rewritten **in place**:
no version is created and nothing else on the version is touched — correcting what was logged is
not iterating.

Every field is labelled with `LabeledContent`, value on the trailing edge, mirroring the read-only
sheet: a placeholder disappears exactly when a form of fifteen fields needs it. Two facts get a
`Toggle` rather than an empty field, because their absence is information a blank cannot express —
« Date de torréfaction connue » (a `DatePicker` always shows *some* date) and « Boisson lactée » (a
drink either has milk or has not).

**A roast date already known is shown, never asked.** The date toggle only exists to declare one
nobody read, so it renders only on a coffee that arrived without a date — a coffee whose date the
import or the previous version carries goes straight to its `DatePicker`. The form reads that at
open and holds it (`roastDateWasRead`): flipping the toggle on must never remove the way back to
« inconnue ».

**Quantities carry a stepper**, the four fields that hold a mass — Dose, Quantité (eau), En tasse,
Quantité (lait): a dose is a dial the cook nudges far more often than a number they retype. Steps
are the ones the hand makes — 0,5 g on a dose, 1 g in the cup, 10 g on a pour — the leading number
moves and the unit is kept as typed, a field with no number yet starts at one step of its own unit,
and nothing goes below zero. Wiring per
[`Stepper` — its label is not a tap target](swiftui-best-practices.md#stepper--its-label-is-not-a-tap-target).
Température, Temps and Mouture stay free text: they are not masses, and « Niveau 12 » is a setting
of one grinder, not a quantity.

Free-text fields use `SuggestingTextField`: chips of what the cook has already typed, shown only
while the field holds the keyboard, hiding an exact match (a button that would do nothing). Typing
anything new is always allowed — it is what teaches the next suggestion. The list comes from the
`coffeeVocabulary` query, loaded when the sheet is opened so the sheet is not what waits on the
network; machine and grinder fall back to the closest earlier version that carried any.

## The oven section — `Features/Oven/`

A cooked version that bakes carries an `OvenProfile`, and the recipe sheet renders it as its own
section under the steps: mode, temperature, then how the cooking ends. **A probe replaces the
timer rather than joining it** — a probe cook shows "Sonde 63 °C" and no "Durée" row at all, so
what ends the cooking is never ambiguous.

`OvenProfileSection` is primitive-first with a nested `Item` (five parameters): it receives
strings already written in French ("180 °C", "25 min") and an SF Symbol name. The page formats;
the section lays out. `OvenProgram` carries its own French label and icon, exactly as `BrewMethod`
and `DishCategory` do.

**A dish that never bakes renders nothing** — no empty section, no "Aucun four" row. The absence
of a profile is the information, the same rule the coffee blocks follow.

### Editing it

`OvenProfileForm` is a section of the [edit sheet](#correcting-a-recipe--one-door-in), saved
through `updateOvenProfile` — **in place, no version created**, exactly as
`updateCoffeeParameters` corrects a coffee. Correcting a temperature you read wrong is not an
iteration on the recipe.

The form's first row is a **"Cuisson au four" toggle**, and turning it off is a real answer: it
saves `nil`, which clears the profile. It is also how a dish that bakes for the first time gets a
profile at all: the read sheet shows no oven section on a dish that has none, and the toggle is
where one starts existing.

**"Copier les réglages du four" is how a profile gets filled in fast.** The API exposes no dish
catalogue — heating functions and dials only, never the "Quiche" the appliance's screen offers —
so the prefill comes from the appliance's *current dials* instead: you set the cooking up on the
oven itself, its own assisted programmes included, and one tap has the recipe remember it. The
button's footer names what it will copy before it copies it, and the row disappears only when the
oven reports **nothing at all** — one reading is enough to make the gesture worth offering.

The copy is as complete as the oven's answer. A dial it reports is taken, a dial it does not is
left to you: requiring a heating function *and* a temperature is what hid the button on a real
oven baking bread at 230 °C for an hour, whose programme code the notebook had no word for — the
mode alone was missing, and it took the two settings that were there down with it. When the mode
is missing the footer says so, because an untouched "Mode" row otherwise reads as the oven's
answer. The timer and the probe keep clearing themselves: an oven reporting no timer is an oven
cooking without one, and that silence is an answer rather than a gap.

**The copy lives in the edit sheet and nowhere else.** The recipe sheet's oven section carries the
settings and the start CTA — writing a profile is what the edit sheet is for, and a second entry
point on the read sheet only made the same gesture reachable twice.

`assisted` is never offered by the picker (`OvenProgram.selectable` drops it): it is not a dial
anyone turns, it only ever arrives by copying what the oven is set to. Picking it by hand would
build a programme with no code behind it, which starts nothing. It joins the list only on a draft
that already carries one, so the row can show what is selected.

The picker lists every function the notebook knows, including ones a given oven lacks — writing
down "Pizza 250 °C" is legitimate even on an oven that cannot run it. Starting it then answers
`PROGRAM_UNSUPPORTED`, which says so; the alternative, hiding the function, would make the
notebook lie about the recipe.

**An assisted cooking is named by the dish it runs**, never by "Cuisson assistée": a mode row that
cannot say *which* programme is a recipe nobody can follow. The appliance hands over a code and no
label, and its API exposes no catalogue, so `assistedNames` in `OvenProgram.swift` holds the pairs
(`ASSIST_QUICHEANDTARTETHIN` → "Quiche et tarte fine") and `label(assisted:)` reads them. The table
is **partial by design**, exactly like the server's `PROGRAM_CODES`: a code with no name yet falls
back to "Cuisson assistée" — the cue to add the pair — rather than being guessed into the wrong
dish.

**The mode is a value, not a value plus a caption**: one line, like the temperature and the
duration next to it — the name, and the function's SF Symbol against it.

That symbol needs laying out by hand, because SwiftUI puts it in a column of its own. A `Label`
used as a `LabeledContent` value pushes the icon half a row away from its title, and the closed row
of a menu `Picker` renders it a size up and further still — and no modifier reaches inside that
row. So both mode rows are built from an `HStack(spacing: Theme.Spacing.xs)` of `Image` + `Text`:
the section's value directly, the form's as the label of a `Menu` wrapping an inline `Picker`,
greyed with `Color.secondary` and closed by a `chevron.up.chevron.down` so it reads as the native
picker it replaces. The list inside keeps the system's own `Label` rows, icons included.

### Starting the cooking

`OvenViewModel` loads `Query.oven` alongside the recipe. **A nil state means this account owns no
oven, and the CTA is then absent entirely** — not disabled, not greyed: an account without an oven
is a smaller app, not a broken one. An oven that is merely offline or refusing remote operation
still shows the button, because pressing it is how the cook learns *why*.

The CTA obeys the "a CTA that hits the network shows it" rule (`ActionIcon` spinner), and it is
never one tap from a heating element: a `confirmationDialog` repeats the exact settings being
sent. While the oven reports a cooking under way, the CTA is replaced by "Cuisson en cours ·
12 min" — a second cooking is never offered.

**An assisted cooking shows the programme to select instead of a CTA.** The oven refuses its own
programmes as a command, so a "Lancer la cuisson" button on such a version could never work: the
page passes `start: nil` and `onAppliance:` instead, and the section renders one grey line —
"Sélectionne « Quiche et tarte fine » sur l'écran du four." Named when the code is known, generic
when it is not, and never a disabled button: there is nothing to wait for and nothing to switch
on. Every heating function keeps its CTA, unchanged.

The refusals are turned into sentences in `APIError.errorDescription`, next to `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`,
not in the view model. `REMOTE_CONTROL_DISABLED` is the one a cook meets most often and the only
one they can act on, so it names the path: *Réglages → Connexions*. `ASSISTED_NOT_STARTABLE` is
the opposite case — nothing the cook switches on will ever make it work, the appliance simply
refuses its own programmes as commands — so the sentence says where the cooking *does* start (the
oven's screen) instead of what to change.

**The state is polled, because nothing pushes it.** The appliance answers a cloud API and takes a
few seconds to admit it is RUNNING, so the state the `startOven` mutation hands back still reads
"idle" — and a cooking dialled in on the oven's own panel never reaches the sheet at all otherwise.
`OvenViewModel.watch()` runs alongside the initial load, in the same `.task`, and dies with it: no
screen anyone left polls a rate-limited API.

Two paces, one rule — **read often only while something is about to change**: every 3 s for the 30 s
following a successful start, every 30 s otherwise (a running cooking counts whole minutes down,
so there is nothing finer to see). The loop ticks every second and decides against `lastRead`
rather than sleeping the whole interval: a sleep already under way would not hear about the start
that just shortened it, which is the cook watching an unchanged button for half a minute. A read
that fails leaves the last state on screen — the network blinked, the oven did not vanish.

## Error reporting — Sentry

`ShuhariApp.init()` calls `SentrySDK.start` (right after `FirebaseApp.configure()`) with a
hardcoded DSN — a Sentry DSN is public by design. A blank/placeholder DSN leaves the SDK inert
(same "no-op on empty DSN" behaviour as the backend plugin). The app reports to the
`shuhari-ios` project of the `polyforms` organisation; the backend has its own project
(`shuhari-server`, DSN passed as the `SENTRY_DSN` repository secret) so a crash in the kitchen
is never mixed up with a fault in the API. `Shared/ErrorReporting.swift`'s
`reportError(_:)` does `SentrySDK.capture(error:)` and returns the display message; the 10+
call sites in ViewModels are unchanged.

## Auth — Firebase + Sign in with Apple

Wired in `Features/Auth/` plus `FirebaseApp.configure()` in `ShuhariApp.init()` (no `AppDelegate`):

- `AuthRoot.swift` — top gate: `LoginView` when signed out, else `ContentView`; injects
  `AuthSession` into the environment.
- `AuthSession.swift` — `@MainActor @Observable` wrapper over Firebase's
  `addStateDidChangeListener`; exposes `user` and `signOut()`.
- `LoginView.swift` — `SignInWithAppleButton`; exchanges the Apple identity token for a Firebase
  credential (`OAuthProvider.appleCredential`), then `Auth.auth().signIn`.
- `AppleNonce.swift` — nonce `random()` + `sha256()` (CryptoKit).
- `Shared/FirebaseTokenInterceptor.swift` — adds `Authorization: Bearer <ID token>` to every
  Apollo request.

## Secrets Setup

The standard GraphQL API authenticates via the Firebase ID token, so no static secret is needed to
run the app. `Shared/Secrets.swift` (gitignored) only holds an optional admin-scoped token; copy the
template on first checkout:

```bash
cp ios/Shuhari/Shared/Secrets.swift.example ios/Shuhari/Shared/Secrets.swift
```

The Sentry DSN is public by design and hardcoded (not a secret). UI tests keep their own
`ShuhariUITests/Support/TestSecrets.swift` (copied from `.example` the same way).

## Model Types

Model structs are `Sendable` (Swift 6). They are what ViewModels and views consume — never the
generated types.

```swift
struct RecipeVersion: Identifiable, Sendable {
    let number: Int
    let change: String?          // what this iteration changed vs. the version it is based on
    let ingredients: [Ingredient]
    let steps: [String]
    let recipeId: String
    // The attempt outcome, recorded directly on the version — nil while never cooked.
    let rating: Int?             // 1..5
    let remarks: String?
    let executedAt: Date?
    let photoUrl: String?
    var id: Int { number }
    var tried: Bool { executedAt != nil }
}
```

## Apollo Codegen

Config: `ios/apollo-codegen-config.json`.

- `schemaNamespace: "ShuhariGraphQL"`
- schema source: `../shared/schema.graphql` (shared with the backend)
- operation search paths: `Shuhari/Features/<Feature>/GraphQL/*.graphql` (hand-written per feature)
- output: `Shuhari/Generated/GraphQL`, `moduleType: embeddedInTarget "Shuhari"`

Regenerate after the SDL changes:

```bash
bun run generate:graphql            # backend: regenerate shared/schema.graphql
bun run generate:ios                # iOS: regenerate Generated/GraphQL
```

## UI Testing — Page Object pattern

`ShuhariUITests/` holds `Tests/` (`ScreenshotTest`, `AttemptLoopFlowTest`, `ImportFlowTest`),
`Pages/` (page objects), and `Support/`.

`BaseUITest` resets the DB before/after and launches with
`-serverURLDev http://localhost:3000 -serverMode dev -UITestPhoto`, adding
`XCUIElement.waitOrFail`/`tapOrFail`. Page objects are `@MainActor struct`s wrapping
`XCUIApplication`, keyed on accessibility identifiers, returning the next page for chaining:

```swift
@MainActor struct HomePage {
    let app: XCUIApplication
    func openRecipe(_ title: String) throws -> RecipeDetailPage { … }
    func openSettings() throws { try app.buttons["home-settings-button"].tapOrFail() }
}
```

`Support/TestAPIClient` is a small REST client used **only** against the test server's helper
endpoints (`/test/reset`, `/test/seed-recipe`) — production data flow stays 100% GraphQL.

## Build

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project ios/Shuhari.xcodeproj -scheme Shuhari \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17,OS=26.2' build
```

`DEVELOPER_DIR` is required because `xcode-select` points at CommandLineTools.
