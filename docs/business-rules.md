# Business Rules — The Product Model

The full narrative of Shuhari's domain model: what a recipe, a version, an attempt, a proposal
*are*, and the invariants every layer must respect. CLAUDE.md's *Key Business Rules* section is
the digest; this doc is the spec. The mechanics of building a domain live in
[domain-guide.md](./domain-guide.md); the style rules referenced here in
[code-style.md](./code-style.md).

## Recipe types and version content

- **Two recipe types** (`RECIPE_TYPE_VALUES`): `dish`, `thermomix`. Ratings are `1..5`.
- **Version content is a discriminated union** (`server/domain/recipe/content/`):
  `VersionContent = DishContent | ThermomixContent`, tagged by `kind` (`'dish' | 'thermomix'`).
  `DishContent` = `ingredients` + plain-text `steps`; `ThermomixContent` = `ingredients` + nested
  `steps: ThermomixStep[]` where each `ThermomixStep = { text; settings }` (settings total — `{}`
  = a plain step). **Invariant `content.kind === recipe.type`** is enforced in
  `RecipeCommand.create`/`addVersion`, returning `'content-type-mismatch' as const` on a mismatch.
  GraphQL mirrors it: a `VersionContent` union (Pothos `unionType`, `resolveType` on `kind`) and a
  `VersionContentInput @oneOf { dish, thermomix }` (`isOneOf: true`).
- **Dish category** (`DISH_CATEGORY_VALUES`): `starter`, `main`, `dessert`, `soup`, `sauce`,
  `baking`, `drink`. Detected by the AI at import and held on the aggregate (never versioned —
  the recipe sheet's edit CTA can refile it via `updateRecipe`); the array order IS the library's
  sort rank, denormalized via `categoryRank`.

## Lineage and attempts

- **Linear lineage**: a recipe owns a chain of `RecipeVersion`s (`v1 → v2 → v3 …`).
  `RecipeVersion.basedOn` is the `VersionNumber` a version was iterated from (**absent** on v1,
  which iterates on nothing). No forks, no variations, no `derivedFrom`.
- **A version *is* an attempt**: its `content` (the `VersionContent` union — `ingredients` +
  `steps`) and lineage (`origin`/`change`/`basedOn`) are immutable; its outcome **and its `tips`**
  are overwritable. An attempt is not an entity. A version with no outcome yet is a *planned*
  attempt: no `executedAt`, no `rating` (the fields are **absent**, never `null`).
- **An attempt lands on the version it produces**, and only a remark-less cook lands on the
  version cooked:
  - **rating (and photo) without remarks** — nothing new is created,
    `RecipeCommand.recordAttempt` writes `rating` (1..5), `executedAt`, `photoPath` onto the
    version cooked and rewrites them in place on a re-cook (dropping the previous photo *and*
    remarks). `remarks` is optional here: a bare rating ends the flow.
  - **with remarks** — the cook asks for the next version, so its `rating`/`remarks`/`photoPath`
    are recorded on the version that answers it, via `RecipeCommand.addVersion`'s `attempt`.
    **The version iterated on is never touched.** Nothing at all is persisted until the proposal
    is accepted: refusing it loses the rating, by design.

## Derivation — no promotion

Everything is derived (`recipe/business-rules.ts`), nothing is promoted:

- `bestRating` = the recipe's best-rated cooked version (highest rating; tie → most recent
  version), `undefined` when nothing was ever cooked; it drives the displayed rating.
- `versionToOpen` = the version the recipe sheet opens on: the best-rated version, else the
  latest (a recipe with no cook behind it). A version waiting to be cooked (`toTest`) never
  opens — the flask CTA is the only way in.

## Improvement and `toTest`

- **Improvement**: the second way to ask for a version, with no cook behind it — the user writes
  what they want changed and
  `ProposalUseCase.fromImprovement(userId, recipeId, versionNumber, improvement)` feeds it to the
  AI in place of the attempts (same ephemeral `Proposal`). Accepting it appends `n+1` **without**
  an attempt, which is the **sole** way a version gets `toTest: true`.
- **`toTest`** (`RecipeVersion.toTest?: true`, absent = not on the list): the versions waiting to
  be cooked, listed by the recipe sheet's flask CTA. Only an improvement raises it; it drops the
  moment the version is cooked — `recordAttempt` rewrites it away, and accepting an attempt-born
  proposal clears it on the version it answers (`basedOn`).

## Tips

**Tips** (`RecipeVersion.tips: Tip[]`): the version's cooking advice ("Servir avec du riz",
"Se congèle bien") — neither an ingredient nor a step. Type-agnostic, so it sits on the
versioning *envelope* (`version.ts`), never in `content`; total (`[]` = none, and the app renders
no section). Three ways in:

1. the AI extracts them at **import** (they land on v1);
2. a **proposal** always returns the complete tips list of the version it creates (the AI folds
   advice it reads in the remarks into it);
3. the recipe sheet's **lightbulb CTA** (`ProposalUseCase.fromTips` → `Ai.formatTips`,
   merged/reworded/deduplicated, then `RecipeCommand.updateTips`) rewrites them **in place on the
   displayed version — no new version, no `toTest`, nothing else touched**.

That in-place rewrite is what keeps `tips` out of `content`: everything in `content` is frozen
for the life of a version.

## Iteration — the attempt travels in the request

`ProposalUseCase.fromAttempt(userId, recipeId, versionNumber, { rating, remarks })` reads the
version cooked and feeds both to the AI (→ `Proposal`, ephemeral, never stored); accepting it
(`ProposalUseCase.accept`) appends version `n+1` via `RecipeCommand.addVersion` with
`origin.kind = 'ai-proposal'`, threading `basedOn = the version cooked` and stamping that attempt
as the new version's outcome. The app only asks for a proposal when remarks were written — a bare
rating ends the flow. Import confirmation persists a fresh recipe + v1 (`origin.kind = 'import'`)
via `RecipeCommand.create` (the `createRecipe` mutation).

## AI wording rules

The prompts in `server/system/ai/index.ts`:

- An ingredient **name** carries its intrinsic *variety/type/grade* in parentheses
  (`Pommes de terre (Marbella)`, `Farine (T45)`) — only *transient* preparation (peeled, sliced)
  goes in the steps.
- An ingredient **quantity** in an imprecise kitchen unit (spoon, pinch, glass, cup…) carries
  its estimated gram equivalent in parentheses, specific to that ingredient
  (`1 c. à café (6 g)` for salt) — quantities already in metric weight/volume and countable
  pieces stay bare.
- A proposal must apply a remark's concrete value change into the right structured field (a
  Thermomix time/temperature/speed in the step `settings`, a duration in the dish step text, a
  quantity on the ingredient) and summarise each change in `changeSummary` as `old → new` — the
  arrow being U+2192 and nothing else, a substitution written like a value change
  (`Citrons jaunes 2-3 pièces → Pomelo 1 pièce`) — several changes joined by `, `
  (`Bouillon 50 → 40 cl, cuisson 3 h 30 → 4 h`). Rendered verbatim as the proposal card's title,
  so the prompt must name the arrow character explicitly: told only "a comma-separated list of
  deltas", the model has answered with the comma as the separator *inside* a change.

## The plan and the monthly AI allowance

The notebook is free and unlimited — recipes, versions, attempts, photos, export. The AI is the
app's only variable cost, so it is the only thing metered (`quota` domain, dimensioned in
[specs/2026-07-20-freemium-pricing-design.md](./specs/2026-07-20-freemium-pricing-design.md)):

- Two meters, `imports` and `iterations`. An **import** is one recipe analysis (`analyzeImport`,
  whatever the source); an **iteration** is one AI call on an existing version — a proposal, an
  improvement *or* a tips merge, all three sharing the same counter.
- `free` gets 3 imports and 5 iterations per **calendar month** (`FREE_LIMITS`), `premium`
  is unlimited. The window IS the month: one document per cook and per month, no reset job, and
  `renewsOn` is the 1st of the next month, UTC.
- **Importing from a URL is Premium.** It is the one call billed per request (Google Search
  grounding), and a free cook is refused before Gemini is ever called (`PREMIUM_REQUIRED`).
- **Check before, record after.** `ProposalUseCase` asks `QuotaQuery.exhaustedFor` before calling
  the AI (a refusal costs nothing, `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`) and `QuotaCommand.record` only once the AI
  has answered: a Gemini failure never costs a cook a quota, and a source with no recipe in it
  (`no-recipe-found`) is a miss, not an import. A cache hit *does* count — the quota is a product
  promise, not a meter on our bill.
- **Premium is bought from Apple, and proved to us.** `EntitlementQuery.planOf` is the single
  answer to "what is this cook entitled to", and it reads the `entitlements` document — written
  only from a transaction whose signature checked out against Apple's root certificates. The app
  is never believed: it hands over the signed transaction, nothing more.
  `NITRO_PREMIUM_USER_IDS` stays as a comp list (the maker's account, a reviewer's).
- **A purchase names its cook.** `appAccountToken` is a version-5 UUID derived from the cook's id
  (`entitlement/business-rules.ts`), handed to StoreKit at purchase time and returned inside the
  signed transaction. A transaction that does not carry it, or carries someone else's, is refused
  — that is what stops a signed receipt from being replayed onto another account. The derivation
  is frozen: changing it detaches every subscription already sold.
- **Cancelling is not losing.** Premium runs to `expiresAt` whatever happens; only a refund
  (`revokedAt`, pushed by the webhook) ends it on the spot.

## Style rules that bite here

See [code-style.md](./code-style.md):

- No `null` in the domain — absence is `field?: T` / `undefined`, converted only at the GraphQL,
  Firestore and AI boundaries.
- Arrays and their items are never optional (`[T!]!` in GraphQL, `{}` for a plain step's
  `ThermomixStep.settings`).
- Enum/union values are English technical symbols (`dish`, `starter`, `ai-proposal`) that the app
  translates.
