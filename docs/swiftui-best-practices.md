# SwiftUI Best Practices

Portable rules — nothing here is specific to this app. Any SwiftUI project can adopt them as is;
the project's own implementation of each rule lives in [ios-guide.md](ios-guide.md).

## A CTA that fires a network call never waits in silence

**Any control that triggers a network call shows its state in the tap itself.** A button that looks
untouched while a request flies is a button the user taps again — duplicate writes, then a screen
that jumps with no explanation. Three shapes, in this order of preference:

### 1. Inline — the icon becomes the spinner

The default for every button that saves, renames, toggles or validates. A tiny reusable atom swaps
the SF Symbol for a `ProgressView`, so no call site re-implements the branch:

```swift
/// An SF Symbol that becomes a spinner while its action is in flight.
struct ActionIcon: View {
    let systemImage: String
    let isRunning: Bool

    var body: some View {
        if isRunning { ProgressView() } else { Image(systemName: systemImage) }
    }
}

Button {
    Task { await save() }
} label: {
    ActionIcon(systemImage: "checkmark", isRunning: isSaving)
}
.disabled(isSaving)
```

Rules that come with it:

- **One source of truth for "in flight."** If the action already runs through a helper that tracks
  its own state (an error presenter, a view model flag), bind the spinner to *that* — never a
  parallel `@State` boolean that can drift out of sync.
- **Refresh inside the in-flight window.** When success is followed by a reload, `await` the reload
  in the same closure rather than in a detached `Task`: otherwise the spinner stops before the view
  can redraw its new state, and the UI shows the old value for a beat.
- **`.interactiveDismissDisabled(isRunning)` on any sheet that writes.** A swipe mid-write orphans
  the task and leaves the user unsure whether anything was saved.
- **A row in a list carries its own spinner**, in its trailing edge — a form with several actions
  needs to say *which* one is running, so track the running action as an enum, not a boolean.

### 2. Long or AI work — the full-bleed loader

A multi-second wait (an LLM call, a heavy analysis) is not a button state: it owns the screen, with
a message saying what is being done. A dedicated loading screen also gives the failure a place to
land — a retry action in context instead of an alert over a frozen form.

### 3. One-way actions — optimistic, in the background

For an action the user cannot undo and has no reason to watch (deleting a row), the best loader is
none: leave the screen immediately, drop the row from the list, and let the call run in an object
that **outlives the view** — a store or view model, not a `Task` spawned by a screen that is about
to disappear (it survives, but it no longer has a view to report into). On failure, report the error
and reload the list, which puts the row back.

### Anti-patterns

- `.disabled(isRunning)` **without** a spinner — the feedback is invisible; the control just stops
  responding.
- An `alert` button that `await`s in silence: the alert dismisses and the screen freezes with no
  indication anything is happening. An alert cannot host a spinner — either move the work to a
  screen that can, or make it optimistic (shape 3).
- A `ProgressView` parked in a section unrelated to the control that was tapped — put it *on* the
  control.
- A spinner with no `.disabled`: it says "working" while still accepting a second tap.

## A list that reopens never opens empty

A screen the user leaves and comes back to is not a first visit. If the rows it showed last time
were on disk, they are what it opens on — the fetch runs underneath, and the screen is readable in
the meantime. A launch that draws a loader over data the device already holds trades a readable
screen for nothing: the fetch takes just as long either way.

The rule holds wherever the data changes slowly and the user recognises it: a library, a feed, a
settings list. It does not hold for data that is worthless when stale — a balance, a live score, a
one-time code — where a stale row read as current is worse than a wait.

Three things make it work, and the third is the one that gets forgotten:

1. **Read the cache before the network, synchronously, in the store's `init`.** An `await` here
   costs a frame of empty screen, which is the whole thing you set out to avoid.
2. **Cache only the view the screen opens on.** A sorted, filtered or paginated-past-the-first-page
   state is a question the user asked, not what to draw on the next launch. Writing page 0 in the
   default order keeps the file small and the restored screen honest.
3. **A refresh with something already on screen must not take it away.** It leads the list with a
   spinner row — the circle a pull-to-refresh draws — and leaves the rows readable and tappable
   underneath. Reuse the loading flag the cold path uses and you re-create the blank screen you
   removed, which is why this state is its own flag.

The cache expires by being overwritten, not by a timer: whatever the server answers replaces it.
Two things must still clear it by hand — the end of a session, since the next user must not read
the previous one's rows, and a shape change to the cached model, which a version stamp in the file
turns into a deliberate miss instead of a wrong decode.

### Anti-patterns

- A **loading flag shared** by the cold start and the refresh: the cached rows appear, then vanish
  behind a loader for the length of the fetch.
- Caching **every sort and facet**: the file grows without bound and the app reopens on a filtered
  view the user left days ago.
- A **silent failed refresh**: the rows stay, nothing says they are last week's. The leading row
  becomes a retry, exactly like the one that closes a paginated list.
- A cache **written to the documents directory**: this is disposable data, and the system must be
  free to reclaim it.

## Every row of a form shares one leading edge

A marker column — a status dot, a drag handle, a checkmark — belongs to **all** the rows of a form
or to none of them. Give it only to the rows that can carry a marker and the labels of the same
section stop lining up: the `Toggle` sits on the standard inset, the marked field sits seven points
further in, and the eye reads the shift as a defect. Two ways out, and only these two:

- **The gutter is conditional, per screen.** When nothing on this screen can ever be marked, drop
  the column entirely — every label keeps SwiftUI's own inset, aligned with the section header.
  When something can, give the gutter to every row, marker or not.
- **Never** reserve it row by row. `if changed { dot }` inside one row and nothing in the next is
  the bug, not the fix.

Wrap the rows in one helper that owns the decision, so a row added later cannot forget it.

## A tappable row is tappable across its whole width

A row that opens something answers a tap **anywhere on it**, not only on its text. The user aims
at the row, not at the words — a tap in the blank middle that does nothing reads as a frozen app,
and the next tap, landing on the title, then looks like a delayed response.

`.buttonStyle(.plain)` is what breaks it: a plain button only hit-tests what is drawn, so the gap a
`Spacer` leaves between the title and the chevron is dead. Give the label a shape:

```swift
Button { onOpen(item.id) } label: {
    HStack {
        Text(item.title)
        Spacer()
        Image(systemName: "chevron.right")
    }
    .contentShape(.rect)
}
.buttonStyle(.plain)
```

- **Put it on the label, not on the button** — the shape has to wrap what the button renders.
- **Put it in the row view itself** when the row is a reusable component, so every caller gets it
  without having to remember.
- A row with a filled background (a card) is already hit-testable everywhere; a row made of text
  and a spacer never is.

### Anti-patterns

- A `.plain` button over an `HStack` with a `Spacer` and no `contentShape`: only the words open it.
- `.onTapGesture` on the row instead of a `Button` to "fix" the zone: it loses the button's
  accessibility trait and its pressed state.

## `Stepper` — its label is not a tap target

`Stepper { label } onIncrement:onDecrement:` swallows the taps landing on its label. A `TextField`
put there renders correctly and **never takes focus**: the value becomes stepper-only, silently.
Keep the field outside and hide the stepper's own label:

```swift
HStack {
    LabeledContent(title) { TextField(title, text: $text) }
    Stepper("") { … } onDecrement: { … }
        .labelsHidden()
}
```

The control is still the native one — typing and stepping are both possible. A stepper over free
text also has to say what it does with text it cannot parse: move the leading number and keep the
rest as typed, and never silently do nothing.

## One state per flow, never one per screen

Screens of the same flow show the same object: a detail, the sheet listing its parts, the child
pushed from that sheet. Giving each its own view model means each fetches that object again, and
that is two bugs at once:

- **latency the user reads as a freeze** — a push that already has everything it needs on screen
  still opens on a spinner, so picking a row feels like nothing happened;
- **screens that contradict each other** — two copies read at two moments, so a badge says nothing
  is pending while the list right under it shows something is. Whichever is right, the user is
  looking at a bug, and no reload of one copy can fix the other.

Own **one observable state for the whole flow**, at the level that outlives its screens (the tab,
the flow's root), and hand it down. Each screen reads what it needs from it; a mutation reloads it
**once** and every screen redraws from the same answer.

```swift
@State private var recipes = RecipeStore()          // the tab owns it
…
.recipeFlow(store: recipes, path: $path, …)         // every pushed screen reads it
```

Reading it makes freshness a policy, not an accident: draw what is known immediately and refresh on
every appearance (`.task { await store.load(id) }`, no `if state == nil` guard) — the screen opens
at once and the fetch behind it only ever corrects it. What is deleted is dropped from the state
explicitly, so a re-entry cannot draw what has just gone.

## Browsing siblings is a state change, not a push

Picking another item of the same object — another version, another photo of the roll, another
day of the week — is **not** a new destination. Pushing one screen per pick stacks screens the
user never asked to keep, and each of them stays alive: it re-runs its `.task` on every
appearance, holds its own network calls, and — when the flow shares one observable state — is
re-rendered by every load any of the others triggers. Ten picks are then a hundred body
evaluations and twenty requests, and the screen the user is looking at is the one that pays for
it. What they report is not "my stack is deep", it is **"the app freezes"**.

Push a *destination*; hold a *selection* in `@State`:

```swift
@State private var selectedVersion: Int?          // what the one screen shows
…
VersionSheet(…) { number in selectedVersion = number }   // hands back an id, nothing else
```

The list hands back an identifier, the screen renders that item from data it already has, and the
back button keeps meaning "leave", not "undo nine picks". A route enum that ends up with one case
is the right outcome, not a smell.

## A row-wide button needs a shape, or its middle is dead

A `Button` whose label spreads content across a row — a title, a `Spacer`, a badge — is only
tappable **where something is drawn**. `.buttonStyle(.plain)` draws no background of its own, so
the gap the `Spacer` opens answers nothing: a tap between the title and the badge falls through to
the list, which does nothing. The row reads as tappable, and does nothing about half the time.

```swift
Button { select() } label: {
    HStack {
        Text(title)
        Spacer()
        Chip(text: badge)
    }
    // Without it, only the text and the chip take the tap.
    .contentShape(.rect)
}
.buttonStyle(.plain)
```

Give the shape to the row component itself rather than to each call site, so a third list built on
it cannot forget it. The same hole is closed by anything that fills the row — a `.background`, a
zero-opacity `NavigationLink` behind it — but a content shape says it in one line and costs nothing
to draw. Any hit-target rule is verified by tapping the row's **empty middle**, never its label:
that is the only tap the bug swallows.
