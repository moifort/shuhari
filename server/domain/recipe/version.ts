// it is a planned attempt while `executedAt` is absent, then carries its outcome
// (rating/remarks/photo). The outcome is overwritable — recording again re-cooks
// the same version in place rather than forcing a new one — and so are the `tips`,
// the only two parts of a version that can be rewritten without creating one.
