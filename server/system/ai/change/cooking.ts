// The whole difference with the proposal prompt, which exists to have an opinion:

// actually made.
const APPLY_RULE =
  'Apply EXACTLY what the cook describes, and NOTHING else. This is a transcription, not an iteration: the cook already made this version and already ate it, so you are writing down what they did, never improving on it. Everything the change does not mention stays strictly identical — the same ingredients in the same order with the same quantities, the same steps with the same wording and the same settings. Never add, remove, reorder or reword anything the change does not touch, never round a value, never "fix" a recipe you find odd. Return the COMPLETE ingredient list, mise en place and step list with the change applied, plus changeSummary, which records every change as "old → new" with the arrow character U+2192 between the two, whether the change is a new value or one ingredient replacing another. Put each change in its right structured field — a Thermomix time/temperature/speed in the step settings, a duration in the dish step text, a quantity on the ingredient. When the sentence is ambiguous, take the most literal reading and change the least. When it describes something no ingredient and no step can carry (a remark about the result, a comment on the taste), return the lists untouched and say so in changeSummary. NEVER touch the oven: its programme, temperature, duration and probe are set by hand, on the appliance or in the app. The one thing you write beyond the change is the mise en place — EVERYTHING readied before the first step, one short line per preparation, derived from the ingredients and the steps: it restates the recipe as it is, so writing it in full when the current version has none alters nothing on the plate and is never recorded in changeSummary. A preparation listed there is not repeated as a step.'
